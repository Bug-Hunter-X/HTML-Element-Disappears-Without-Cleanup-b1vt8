# Uncommon HTML Bug: Unexpected Element Removal

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in HTML where an element is removed from the DOM but its space isn't handled properly, potentially resulting in unexpected layout shifts or visual glitches. The primary issue lies in how the script handles the removal of an element without appropriate cleanup.

## Bug Description

The provided HTML displays a div element.  A button, upon clicking, hides this div using JavaScript. However, after the div is hidden, the space it occupies remains, creating an empty space on the page.  The script doesn't address the space vacated by the removed element. This is more pronounced if the div has a fixed height.

## Solution

The solution involves additional code to better manage the element's removal or to use alternative techniques that prevent the empty space from being visible.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.html` in your web browser.
3. Click the button. Observe the empty space left behind.
4. Open `bugSolution.html` to see the corrected version.
